If this is unsuccessful, Junkey will refund the purchase funds to the buyer and remove the trade block on the item.

Any ensuing dispute relating to the agreement between the buyer and seller is a private matter between the two users.
d) If the seller's email address is determined to be ineligible to receive funds at the point the buyer attempts to make payment, Junkey will attempt to resolve but reserve the right to cancel the payment. If Junkey are unable to resolve the issue, the trade will be cancelled.
